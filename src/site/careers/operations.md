A rack-scale computer is an extraordinarily complicated machine that requires
exceptional attention to detail through the entire process, including design,
manufacturing, supply chain, logistics, delivery, installation, and lifecycle
management.

<!--more-->

As an operations manager working at Oxide, you will:

- **Collaborate with other functions across hardware and software
  engineering** to understand the product bill of materials (BOM) and
  implement or develop best practices around master data management and supply
  chain integrity as we scale.

- **Operate across internal and external stakeholders in collaboration with
  our OEM** to understand the materials and data/information needs for our
  manufacturing process including supply/demand management (SDM), master
  production schedules (MPS), clear to build (CTB), and product lifecycle
  management (PLM).

- **Develop a robust logistics process** from the ground up as we prepare to
  support our first customer orders.

- **Architect best practices for spares inventory management** as we prepare
  to support full service contracts with short SLA to warranty repairs or
  replacements.

- **Develop strategic relationships with supply chain partners** from
  manufacturers to distributors, with a focus on pricing negotiation, and
  mitigating supply risk via various techniques (inventory control, dual
  sourcing components, long lead forecasting, capacity planning, etc).

- **Nimbly manage projects large and small** as we scale our operations across
  products, services, customers, distributors, and suppliers while optimizing
  cost, schedule, and performance tradeoffs to achieve strategic intent.

- **Make order fulfillment part of what our customers love about us** with
  rigorous attention to detail, proactive risk management and contingency
  planning, and responding with an appropriate sense of urgency to emerging
  issues.

- **Be ready to represent Oxide to our customers** with an understanding of
  the various factors driving their order and delivery timelines and how we
  can harmonize our operations to exceed their expectations.

- **Contribute** to other, non-ops specific areas of the product that interest
  you.

These responsibilities are just a starting place! We’re a small company, we
don’t have rigid roles, and we have a lot to do -- we can help you grow
wherever your interests take you.

You will thrive in this role if you:

- Have previously worked in supply chain or operations where hardware was
  being built.
- Can understand complex technical topics and distill them down.
- Are energized by the thought of jumping between traditional roles and silos.
- Produce good documentation and/or written descriptions of your ideas.
- Get excited about a wide range of technical topics and dig really deep into
  them.
- Don’t mind coworkers getting really excited about decades-old computers.

If you don’t meet 100% of these qualifications you should still seriously
consider applying -- at least one of us was missing each of these at the
outset!

### Life at Oxide

We are very explicit about <a href="/about">our values</a>, and they can
be seen in daily life at Oxide, for example:

- Our **rigor** means we enjoy and take pride in our craft.
- Our **urgency** means that we are not above the judicious short-cut.
- Our **versatility** is reflected in our greatest strength: the breadth of
  our team.
- Our **transparency** can be seen in our consensus-driven
  <a href="/blog/rfd-1-requests-for-discussion/">RFD process</a>.
- Our **responsibility** means that we both lead and follow:  we have our own
  domains, but we also help others on their parts.
- Our **curiosity** shows in our insatiable desire to learn -- and our
  **empathy** in our love of teaching others.
- Our **humor** is a big part of our daily lives: we are inveterate
  wise-crackers whose video meetings spill into simultaneous text chat.

Our values also manifest themselves in our benefits:

- <a href="/blog/compensation-as-a-reflection-of-values/">Everyone
  makes $180,250, regardless of location.</a>
- We offer the best health insurance we could find:
  medical PPO plan, dental, and vision that are 100% covered for both employees
  *and* dependents.
- We are very supportive of remote work. About half of our team is outside of
  the San Francisco Bay Area; our only requirement is working hours with a
  significant overlap with Pacific Time.
- Our families and lives outside of our jobs are very important to us;
  our schedules are flexible to reflect and support that.
